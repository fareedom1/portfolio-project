    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p> This portfolio gives you a deeper look at my skills, interests, and personality beyond my resume. Whether you’re an employer or a collaborator, I’d love for you
         to get to know me better.</p> 
    
    <p>I’m a Computer Science student at Florida Atlantic University, set to graduate in January 2027 with a 3.9 GPA. I specialize in building logical, efficient, and user-friendly applications using Python, C++, JavaScript, and React.
    </p>
   <p>My experience includes instructing students in fundamental coding at Code Ninjas, where I teach programming concepts to students aged 7–14 using Scratch, JavaScript, and Python. 
      During my time working at code ninjas, I also collbaroatred with one of the clients to design an educational website. Alongside this, I built personal projects that blend logic, creativity, and technical depth.
   </p>
    <p class = "important">This portfolio gives you a closer look at the skills, mindset, and work ethic I bring to the table. Scroll through to see my projects, GitHub, and links to current work. I hope this helps you see who I am — beyond bullet points on a resume.
    </p>
